              powerful tool to identify genes associated with human diseases by
              aggregating cis-regulatory effects on gene expression. However,
              TWAS relies on building predictive models of gene expression,
              which are sensitive to the sample size and tissue on which they
              are trained. The Gene Tissue Expression Project has produced
              reference transcriptomes across 53 human tissues and cell types;
              however, the data is highly sparse, making it difficult to build
              polygenic models in relevant tissues for TWAS. Here, we propose
              `fQTL', a multi-tissue, multivariate model for mapping expression

              assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a
              single tissue or small sets of tissues. Here, we built networks
              that additionally capture the regulation of relative isoform
              abundance and splicing, along with tissue-specific connections
              unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data
              across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a
              framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining
              total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse
              network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of

              found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for
              splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in
              unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome.
              Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies

              Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10

  abstract  = "Pathway analyses of genome-wide association studies aggregate
               information over sets of related genes, such as genes in common
               pathways, to identify gene sets that are enriched for variants
               associated with disease. We develop a model-based approach to
               pathway analysis, and apply this approach to data from the
               Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) studies. Our
               method offers several benefits over existing approaches. First,
               our method not only interrogates pathways for enrichment of
               disease associations, but also estimates the level of
               enrichment, which yields a coherent way to promote variants in
               enriched pathways, enhancing discovery of genes underlying
               disease. Second, our approach allows for multiple enriched
               pathways, a feature that leads to novel findings in two diseases
               where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a major
               determinant of disease susceptibility. Third, by modeling
               disease as the combined effect of multiple markers, our method
               automatically accounts for linkage disequilibrium among
               variants. Interrogation of pathways from eight pathway databases
               yields strong support for enriched pathways, indicating links
               between Crohn's disease (CD) and cytokine-driven networks that
               modulate immune responses; between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
               ``Measles'' pathway genes involved in immune responses triggered
               by measles infection; and between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
               IL2-mediated signaling genes. Prioritizing variants in these
               enriched pathways yields many additional putative disease
               associations compared to analyses without enrichment. For CD and
               RA, 7 of 8 additional non-MHC associations are corroborated by
               other studies, providing validation for our approach. For T1D,
               prioritization of IL-2 signaling genes yields strong evidence
               for 7 additional non-MHC candidate disease loci, as well as
               suggestive evidence for several more. Of the 7 strongest
               associations, 4 are validated by other studies, and 3 (near IL-2
               signaling genes RAF1, MAPK14, and FYN) constitute novel putative

              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes
              (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of
              genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand
              their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is
              ``mediation'' by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation
              analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in
              order to identify transcripts that are ``cis-mediators'' of
              trans-eQTLs, including those ``cis-hubs'' involved in regulation
              of many trans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps us
              understand regulatory networks and suggests biological mechanisms
              underlying trans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for
              understanding susceptibility to complex diseases. The multitissue
              expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
              program provides a unique opportunity to study cis-mediation

              this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis
              with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the
              search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects
              potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses
              of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive
              selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision
              of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides
              new insights into the observed patterns of cis-hubs and

               thought to be a complex interplay of technical, compositional,
               and disease-related factors. To better understand these
               contributions, we investigated expression variability in a
               relatively homogeneous tissue expression dataset from the

               identifying technical sources, such as sequencing date and
               post-mortem interval, we also identified several biological
               sources of variation. An in-depth analysis of the 175 genes with
               the greatest variation among 133 lung tissue samples identified
               five distinct clusters of highly correlated genes. One large
               cluster included surfactant genes (SFTPA1, SFTPA2, and SFTPC),
               which are expressed exclusively in type II pneumocytes, cells
               that proliferate in ventilator associated lung injury. High
               surfactant expression was strongly associated with death on a
               ventilator and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. A second large
               cluster included dynein (DNAH9 and DNAH12) and mucin (MUC5B and
               MUC16) genes, which are exclusive to the respiratory epithelium
               and goblet cells of bronchial structures. This indicates
               heterogeneous bronchiole sampling due to the harvesting location
               in the lung. A small cluster included acute-phase reactant genes
               (SAA1, SAA2, and SAA2-SAA4). The final two small clusters were
               technical and gender related. To summarize, in a collection of
               normal lung samples, we found that tissue heterogeneity caused
               by harvesting location (medial or lateral lung) and late
               therapeutic intervention (mechanical ventilation) were major
               contributors to expression variation. These unexpected sources
               of variation were the result of altered cell ratios in the

              large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
              discovered only a handful of markers associated with the disease.
              Furthermore, the biological mechanisms underlying these markers
              need to be elucidated. We recently published a gene-level
              association test, PrediXcan that integrates transcriptome
              regulation data to characterize the function of these markers in
              a tissue specific manner. In this study, we developed prediction
              models for mRNA levels in 10 brain regions using data from the
              GTEx project and performed PrediXcan analysis in WTCCC as well as

              between predicted expression of PTPRE and BD risk in whole blood

              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes
              (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of
              genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand
              their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is
              ``mediation'' by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation
              analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in
              order to identify transcripts that are ``cis-mediators'' of
              trans-eQTLs, including those ``cis-hubs'' involved in regulation
              of many trans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps us
              understand regulatory networks and suggests biological mechanisms
              underlying trans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for

              this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis
              with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the
              search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects
              potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses
              of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive
              selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision
              of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides
              new insights into the observed patterns of cis-hubs and

               estimation of variances}",
  author    = "Lu, Mengyin and Stephens, Matthew",
  abstract  = "MOTIVATION:Genomic studies often involve estimation of variances
               of thousands of genes (or other genomic units) from just a few
               measurements on each. For example, variance estimation is an
               important step in gene expression analyses aimed at identifying
               differentially-expressed genes. A common approach to this
               problem is to use an Empirical Bayes (EB) method that assumes
               the variances among genes follow an inverse-gamma distribution.
               This distributional assumption is relatively inflexible; for
               example, it may not capture ``outlying'' genes whose variances
               are considerably bigger than usual. Here we describe a more
               flexible EB method, capable of capturing a much wider range of
               distributions. Indeed, the main assumption is that the
               distribution of the variances is unimodal (or, as an
               alternative, that the distribution of the precisions is
               unimodal). We argue that the unimodal assumption provides an
               attractive compromise between flexibility, computational
               tractability and statistical efficiency. RESULTS:We show that
               this more flexible approach provides competitive performance
               with existing methods when the variances truly come from an
               inverse-gamma distribution, and can outperform them when the
               distribution of the variances is more complex. In analyses of
               several human gene expression datasets from the Genotype Tissues
               Expression (GTEx) consortium, we find that our more flexible
               model often fits the data appreciably better than the single
               inverse gamma distribution. At the same time we find that in
               these data this improved model fit leads to only small
               improvements in variance estimates and detection of
               differentially expressed genes. AVAILABILITY:Our methods are

               quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis
               of SVs, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short
               insertion/deletion (indel) variants from deep whole-genome
               sequencing (WGS). We estimated that SVs are causal at 3.5-6.8\%
               of eQTLs[mdash]a substantially higher fraction than prior
               estimates[mdash]and that expression-altering SVs have larger
               effect sizes than do SNVs and indels. We identified 789 putative
               causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression: most
               (88.3\%) were noncoding variants enriched at enhancers and other
               regulatory elements, and 52 were linked to genome-wide
               association study loci. We observed a notable abundance of rare

  abstract  = "With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing
               of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become
               commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of
               features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null
               hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be

               statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on
               the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a
               sensible balance between the number of true and false positives
               that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In
               doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q
               value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is
               similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of
               significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than
               the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false
               positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than

  author    = "Mitchell, T J and Beauchamp, J J",
  abstract  = "Abstract This article is concerned with the selection of subsets
               of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the
               prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian
               approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability
               distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through
               the specification of a family of prior distributions for the
               unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not
               fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior
               distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is
               assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the
               corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent
               prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to
               deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of
               a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere,
               that is, a ?spike and slab? distribution. The random error
               component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and
               standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally
               uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate
               posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the
               regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior
               distribution depends only on the data and the parameter ?, which
               is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for
               the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a
               probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter
               that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods.
               Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing
               ?, assessing the complexity of the response function and the
               strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing
               the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following
               plots against ? are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a
               particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected
               number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the
               submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e)
               posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are
               suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is
               determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that
               generates a predictive density for each observation, given all
               of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ?leave
               one out? approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the
               posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F
               test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a
               specified level of significance. The dependence of the results
               on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to
               choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a
               large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are
               given to demonstrate the application of the methods.",

              novel disease loci or pinpoint the susceptibility gene at a known
              disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL
              genes co-localize at disease loci (an effect of linkage
              disequilibrium, LD), making the identification of the true
              susceptibility gene challenging. To distinguish between true
              susceptibility genes (i.e. when the genetic effect on phenotype
              is mediated through expression) and spurious co-localizations, we
              developed an approach to quantify the genetic effect mediated
              through expression. Our approach can be viewed as an extension of
              the standard Mendelian randomization Egger technique to
              incorporate LD among variants while only requiring summary
              association data (both GWAS and eQTL) along with LD from
              reference panels. Through simulations we show that when eQTLs
              have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease, our
              approach provides adequate control of Type I error, more power,
              and less bias than previously-proposed methods. When there is no
              effect of gene expression on disease, our method has the desired
              Type I Error, while LD-aware Mendelian randomization, which
              assumes no pleiotropy, can have inflated Type I Error. In the
              presence of direct effect of genetic variants on traits, our
              approach attained up to 3x greater power than the standard
              approaches while properly controlling Type I error. To illustrate
              our method, we analyzed recent large scale breast cancer GWAS

               inferring multiple causal variants per locus and causal variants
               across multiple related diseases using a large number of
               annotations. Moreover, many complex traits are not only
               genetically related but also potentially share causal
               mechanisms. We develop an integrative Bayesian fine-mapping
               model named RiVIERA-MT. The key features of RiVIERA-MT include:
               1) the ability to model epigenomic covariance of multiple
               related traits; 2) efficient posterior inference of causal
               configuration; 3) efficient Bayesian inference of enrichment
               parameters, allowing incorporation of large number of functional
               annotations; 4) simultaneously modeling the underlying
               heritability parameters. We conducted a comprehensive simulation
               studies using 1000 Genome and ENCODE/Roadmap epigenomic data to
               demonstrate that RiVIERA-MT compares quite favorably with
               existing methods. In particular, the efficient inference of
               multiple causal variants per locus led to significantly improved
               estimation of causal posterior and functional enrichments
               compared to the state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods.
               Furthermore, joint modeling multiple traits confers further
               improvement over the single-trait mode of the same model, which
               is attributable to the more accurate estimation of the
               functional priors. We applied RiVIERA-MT to 27 GWAS summary
               statistics, in-cis eQTL of risk genes in 44 tissues from GTEx
               samples, and finally to infer causal GWAS/eQTL SNPs, causal
               genes, and causal pathways. To leverage potential
               tissue-specific epigenomic co-enrichments among these traits, we
               harnessed hundreds of functional annotations compiled from
               ENCODE/Roadmap consortium. Overall, we observed an improved
               power in detecting functionally coherent risk SNPs with the

              studies are present in non-coding regions of the genome. It is
              hypothesized that these variants affect complex traits by acting
              as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that influence
              expression of nearby genes. This indicates that many causal
              variants for complex traits are likely to be causal variants for
              gene expression. Hence, identifying causal variants for gene
              expression is important for elucidating the genetic basis of not
              only gene expression but also complex traits. However, detecting
              causal variants is challenging due to complex genetic correlation
              among variants known as linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the
              presence of multiple causal variants within a locus. Although
              several fine-mapping approaches have been developed to overcome
              these challenges, they may produce large sets of putative causal
              variants when true causal variants are in high LD with many

              source of information that can be used to improve fine-mapping
              called allele-specific expression (ASE) that measures imbalance

              identifies the true causal variants with higher specificity than
              an approach that uses only eQTL information. In the GTEx dataset,

              disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL

              developed an approach to quantify the genetic effect mediated

              the standard Mendelian randomization Egger technique to

              association data (both GWAS and eQTL) along with LD from

              approaches while properly controlling Type I error. To illustrate

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands
              of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the
              biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in
              general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association
              method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular
              mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The
              approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by
              an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene
              expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify
              genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically
              regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome
              tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference
              transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of
              gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and
              a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our
              results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes
              associated with disease traits and provide insights into the
              mechanism of these associations.",

  abstract = "The impact of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in
              humans is well-established. The majority of known expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes
              (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of
              genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand
              their biological mechanisms. One commontrans-eQTLs mechanism is
              ``mediation'' by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation
              analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in
              order to identify transcripts that are ``cis-mediators''
              oftrans-eQTLs, including those ``cis-hubs'' involved in
              regulation of manytrans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps
              us understand regulatory networks and suggests biological
              mechanisms underlyingtrans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for
              understanding susceptibility to complex diseases. The multitissue
              expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
              program provides a unique opportunity to studycis-mediation
              across human tissue types. However, the presence of complex
              hidden confounding effects in biological systems can make
              mediation analyses challenging and prone to confounding bias,
              particularly when conducted among diverse samples. To address
              this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis
              with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the
              search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects
              potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses
              of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive
              selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision
              of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides
              new insights into the observed patterns ofcis-hubs andtrans-eQTL
              regulation across tissue types.",
